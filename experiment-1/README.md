# Experiment 1
## Goal: Get a response with the current weather data at my university.
This is a very simple program as I just wanted to get a response and have an easy way of testing parameters before adding anything else.
## To run:
Note: An api key from a free account at https://openweathermap.org/api is needed to run this.
1. Create a .env file in this experiment-1 folder (the same location as this README).
2. Add a WEATHER_API_KEY variable and set it to the api key from OpenWeather.
3. Run the test.py
## Changing parameters:
This program is set to request the data regarding the current weather api at https://openweathermap.org/current.

You can change the link for one of their different apis, or change the parameters to other ones for further testing. For example going on google maps and right clicking a location gives it latitude and longitude, then that can be copied into params for a new location.
